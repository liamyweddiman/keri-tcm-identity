# Overview  
## KERI for TCM Credential Governance and Herbal Medicine Provenance  
**Author: Liam YW Eddiman**

This project explores how KERI (Key Event Receipt Infrastructure) can serve as a
trustworthy identity and provenance foundation for the Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) ecosystem.

The goal is to model two interconnected identity layers:

1. **Practitioner Identity & Credential Governance**  
   Enabling verifiable lineage, training, certification, and cross-border medical license validation.

2. **Traditional Medicine & Herbal Product Provenance**  
   Ensuring batch-level authenticity, processing integrity, and international traceability through an event-based chain.

By combining cultural identity (lineage, apprenticeship, heritage) with regulated
healthcare identity (licenses, training, compliance), KERI provides a secure way
to represent complex, multi-layered TCM credentials and product histories.
