# KERI-TCM-Identity  
### A KERI-based Identity Framework for TCM Practitioners & Traditional Medicine Provenance  
**Author: Liam YW Eddiman**

---

## 🔍 Overview
This repository explores how **KERI (Key Event Receipt Infrastructure)** can support a trustworthy, verifiable identity infrastructure for the Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) ecosystem.

The project focuses on two core domains:

1. **TCM Practitioner Credential Governance**
   - Apprenticeship & lineage attestation  
   - Institutional training & certification records  
   - Cross-border medical license verification  
   - Decentralized clinical activity & renewal logs  

2. **Traditional Medicine & Herbal Product Provenance**
   - Farm-level origin authentication  
   - Processing & extraction event chains  
   - Laboratory testing & batch attestation  
   - Export certification & pharmaceutical integration  

---

## 🧬 Motivation
Traditional medicine systems face persistent challenges:

- Inconsistent credentialing standards across countries  
- Difficulty verifying lineage and apprenticeship claims  
- Counterfeit or unclear-origin herbal products  
- Weak international interoperability of medical licenses  

**KERI’s event-based identifier model** provides a secure, auditable foundation for solving these problems by enabling cryptographically verifiable histories of identity, skills, and product provenance.

## 🧱 KERI Identity Architecture (Concept)
### Practitioner Identity Event Chain
- `Inception` – Practitioner AID creation  
- `Lineage Attestation` – Master/institution endorsements  
- `Training Record Events` – Hospitals, colleges, or programs  
- `License Issuance` – Local or national medical boards  
- `Cross-border License Binding` – AU/EU/US/ASEAN equivalency  
- `Renewal / Discipline Events`  
- `Revocation` (if applicable)  

### Herbal Product Provenance Chain
- `Origin Event` – Farm/region batch AID  
- `Harvest` – Date, geo-location, variety  
- `Processing Attestation` – Drying, extraction, compounding  
- `Laboratory QC Events` – Purity, safety, heavy metal testing  
- `Packaging & Lot Creation`  
- `Export Certification`  
- `Pharmaceutical Manufacturer Receipt`

## 🚀 Roadmap
| Phase | Milestone |
|-------|-----------|
| **Phase 1** | Document KERI architecture for TCM identity (current) |
| **Phase 2** | Build conceptual JSON-based data models |
| **Phase 3** | Draft implementable event schemas (practitioner + herbal products) |
| **Phase 4** | Publish use-case notes to DIF/KERI working group |
| **Phase 5** | Prototype verification UI (Figma or JS) |

## 🤝 Contributions & Community Work
This project aims to contribute use-case documentation and identity models to:

- **DIF KERI Working Group**  
- **Healthcare identity research communities**  
- **Traditional medicine regulatory discussions (global)**  

Discussions, issues, and PRs are welcome.
