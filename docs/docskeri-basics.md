# KERI Basics  
## Why KERI Matters for Healthcare & Cultural Identity

KERI (Key Event Receipt Infrastructure) is a decentralized identity framework
based on *key state events* rather than static identifiers.

### Key Properties
- **Event-based trust** — identity evolves through cryptographically verifiable events.  
- **No blockchain dependency** — lighter, more interoperable.  
- **Universal verifiability** — receipts from witnesses guarantee integrity.  
- **Secure key rotation** — ideal for long-lived professional identities.  

### Relevance to TCM & Healthcare
TCM practitioners often rely on:
- Lineage and apprenticeship relationships  
- Institutional training from diverse systems  
- Multi-jurisdictional medical practice  
- Herbal medicine supply chains with varied provenance  

KERI’s event model can authenticate:
- Who trained whom  
- When a qualification was issued  
- Which authority signed a license  
- How herbal materials flowed from farm to product  

This makes KERI an ideal foundation for TCM identity infrastructure.
